## Features

- **Random discussion buttons** - Configurable buttons that fetch a random discussion from a specific tag (perfect for "Random HD movie", "Random TV series", etc.). Fully customizable via JSON.
- **Tracker info panel** - Display BitTorrent tracker announce URLs with copy-to-clipboard support, custom message and sub-message.
- **Dual statistics system** - Show both internal forum statistics (from the database) and external OpenTracker statistics side by side:
  - **Internal stats** - Torrents, users, magnets, downloads, views, average rating (pulled directly from the forum database)
  - **External stats (OpenTracker)** - Seeds, peers, completed downloads, uptime. Two modes:
    - **Native** - Direct connection to OpenTracker XML endpoint (`/stats?mode=everything`)
    - **Proxy** - JSON proxy URL for environments where direct access is not possible
  - Configurable refresh interval (1-300 seconds)
- **Custom links bar** - Configurable color-coded link buttons defined via JSON (label, URL, color, external flag).
- **Advanced discussion filters** - Powerful filter bar for the discussion list with 7 filter types:
  - Title search
  - User search
  - Rating interval (requires `tryhackx/flarum-topic-rating`)
  - Date interval (Today, 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3/6 months, 1 year)
  - Category (tag) selection
  - Sort by (Steam DB rating, average rating, rating count, recently rated, creation date, views, magnet clicks)
  - Sort direction (ascending/descending)
- **Content validation overrides** - Override Flarum's built-in title and content length limits without touching the core:
  - Title length: 1-200 characters (varchar(200) column max)
  - Content length: 0-16,000,000 characters (mediumtext column max)
  - Toggle each independently
- **reCAPTCHA protection** - Optional reCAPTCHA v2/v3 protection for the stats API endpoint.
- **Collapsible sections** - Section 1 (random buttons + stats) can be collapsed by default to save space.
- **Hide hero banner** - Optional toggle to hide Flarum's default hero banner.
- **Tag filtering** - Show only tags that have discussions, optionally with discussion counts next to tag names.
- **Polish & English locales** - Fully translated interface.
